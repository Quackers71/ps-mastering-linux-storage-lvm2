# Linux Storage Management with LVM
* Managing Logical Volumes

- Understanding LVM
- Configuring the LVM system
- Using Ansible configuration management
- Configuring storage layers
- Managing volume groups and volumes
- LVM thin-provisioning
- Snapshotting logical volumes
- Migrating to new hardware
- Creating special purpose volumes

* Lab System

- You can use Ubuntu 18.04 for the demonstrations but any recent Linux
  distribution will suffice, labs will require root access
- It's possible to use AWS or other cloud based systems
- A single system is enough for this course but you could use three 
  systems to highlight the advantages of using Ansible as a 
  configuration management system.

* Logical Volume Management (LVM)
- Aggregating block storage to re-allocate as needed in the form of
  device-mapper volumes.

$ lsblk #List block devices
$ sudo dmsetup ls --tree #List device-mapper devices

# Installing the LVM Package
- LVM may already be installed depending on how the disks were setup
on your system.  If it is not installed we can add the package.

$ sudo lvm version || sudo apt install -y lvm2 # Install lvm2 if not installed

* Demo - Checking the existing system
- List block devices
- List device-mapper devices
- These commands help us better understand the system we have
  Testing for the version of LVM is a sure fire way to
  to determine if it is installed.

# Understanding the Layered Storage Model of LVM2
* LVM Layers
* Layered storage in LVM
- Physical
- Volume Groups
- Logical Volumes
  Using the command line to discover the layers you
  have in-place on your system.

* LVM Storage Layers

- Logical Volumes - Dev-mapper devices which are formatted and 
  	presented to the consumer as a block device.

- Volume Groups - Volume Groups acts as storage pools, aggregating
  	storage together and overcoming the limitations of 
  	physical storage size.

- Physical Volumes - Physical storage existing on the host as disks,
	partitions and raw files.

* Managing LVM

- Physical Volumes - pvs, pvmove & pvcreate
- Volume Groups - vgscreate, vgs & vgdisplay
- Logical Volumes - lvs, lvcreate & lvresize

$ hostnamectl # shows the OS you are running
$ pvs # Lists our physical volumes
# Output TBC

$ fallocate -l 500m /tmp/file1 # This will create a raw disc file
$ ls -larth /tmp/file1 # listing the raw disc file
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 500M Nov 25 10:50 /tmp/file1

* Now create a loopback device
$ losetup -l
# Output TBC

$ losetup -f
/dev/loop0

$ losetup -f /tmp/file1
$ losetup -l
NAME	   SIZELIMIT OFFSET AUTOCLEAR RO BACK-FILE  DIO LOG-SEC
/dev/loop0	   0	  0	    0  0 /tmp/file1   0     512

$ pvcreate /dev/loop0
 Physical volume "/dev/loop0" successfully created.
